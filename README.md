# my_LRC
This is a statistical learning course project - a LRC algorithom with a course report

This algorithm is from this paper:\
Naseem I, Togneri R, Bennamoun M. Linear regression for face recognition[J]. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 2010, 32(11): 2106-2112.\
And it can be seen at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5506092/

Additionally, I have used the AT&T face dataset in this project:\

Programming language is Python.

There may be nothing to say.
